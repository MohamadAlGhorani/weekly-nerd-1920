      <h2>Welcome nerd!</h2>
      <p>
        Weekly nerd is a course at the Web Development Minor in the Amsterdam University of Applied Science (HvA). During this minor every week a presentation is held by someone from the professional Web Development field. Those presentations are held at the school or at the companies. The aim of this course is to increase our knowledge about the Web Development field, get in touch with digital companies and future colleagues, and to expand our network. Because of the Corona pandemic, we only had the chance to get three presentations.<br>
        During each presentation, I took notes and then wrote an article about it. The first three articles of this Weekly Nerd blog are from three different presentations given by three different people.<br>
        Beside the presentation, we had to write three articles on a chosen subject that is relevant to this minor.<br>
